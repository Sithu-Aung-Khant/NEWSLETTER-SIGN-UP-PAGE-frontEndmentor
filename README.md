### What I learned

##### Adjusting Text Boldness: A Creative Solution
- While working on the project, I faced a unique challengeâ€”getting the text boldness just right. The available options were 500 bold weight and 600 bold weight, but my preferred level of boldness fell in between.
- Opting for 500 made the text too light, while 600 made it overly bold. Searching for a fix, I discovered an ingenious solution with ChatGPT. Instead of changing the font weight, I used a text-shadow effect. This simple trick allowed me to achieve the perfect boldness for the text, meeting my requirements exactly.

This experience not only solved my challenge but also taught me a new way to approach styling.
##### Mini lessons

- I learned how to add svg files to HTML.
- I learned that I can import image/svg in in <ul> element using ```list-style-image: url(); ```
- When selecting elements in JS (```getElementById``` or ```querySelector```), it's important to be cautious and include the appropriate object (```document```). I was able to identify this issue only after 30 minutes of headache.
- In certain situations, styling based on elements proves to be more effective..
- Utilizing ```"font-family: inherit"``` within an input element is a clever method for inheriting the font family from its parent element.
- Using a transition effect (```"transition: all 1s"```) when hovering over a button adds an appealing touch.
- I discovered the simplicity of the ```.hide``` class with ```display: none``` prpperty to manipulate displaying elements effortlessly.
- using definite pixel width in main/card element is a good practice.
